### üöß **In Development**

While **Xip** already offers many powerful features, it‚Äôs still in heavy development! We have many exciting features planned, which you can find in our **[Roadmap](#Roadmap)**. My main goal for this project
is to allow users to completly customize a workflow that suits them best.

<h1>üêõKnown Bugs</h1>

- Grid Panels can be lost off screen if sized too large. Only solution right now is to refresh the app
- ~~There is a small chance (it happened once in hundreds of test during development) a process can get hung on the target machine when running Event Viewer. This locks the exe file, not allowing you to read, run, or modify the exe. End the process or restart both systems to fix.~~ (**Resolved**)
- Responsivness on ultrawides is incorrect. UI elements will be sized incorrectly.
- Device Mananger opens the local machines devices instead of targeted machine.


<h1>Installation</h1>

You can find the initial pre-release v0.1.0-alpha under the releases section in the repo. Alternatively, you can find the .exe in `src-tauri/target/release`. A unistaller is also included.


<h1>‚ÑπÔ∏èAdditional Information</h1>

> [NOTE]
>Xip is still in **heavy** development and is being worked on quite frequently. This has been a learning and hobby project for myself, and I do appreciate all feedback. Expect some errors and inefficiencies. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
>Some functions require remote powershell, however only a few. For larger environments this can easily be enabled in Group policy. The program needs to be ran as administrator, it currently does not auto auth via windows credentials.
